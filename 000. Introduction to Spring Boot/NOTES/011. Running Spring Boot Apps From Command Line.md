We spend most of our time developing the Spring Boot applications in the IDEs so we usually do not care about running the applications using the command-line.

Almost every IDE will have the option to run a Spring Boot application.

But, we may want to run our Spring Boot app outside of the IDE. And one approach is using the command-line.

When we want to run the Spring Boot app using the command-line, there is no need to have an IDE open.

As we know, Spring Boot comes with an embedded server so the JAR file will have not just the code but also the embedded server. Hence, when we run it from the command line, it will also spin up the server.

# TWO OPTIONS TO RUN SPRING BOOT APPS FROM THE COMMAND-LINE

One option is to use the "java -jar" command to run the Spring Boot application.

So, if our Spring Boot application is "myapp.jar", we can run - 

    java -jar myapp.jar

The second option is to use the Spring Boot Maven plugin and use this command - 

    mvnw spring-boot:run

# STEPS

So, the steps are like this -

    1. Exit the IDE
    2. Package the app using "mvnw package"
    3. Run the app using any one of the two options above
