Maven is a Project Management tool developed by Apache to build, publish, and deploy several projects at once for better project management.

When building your project, you may need additional JAR files like Spring, Hibernate, Common Logging, etc. One approach is to download them from each project's website. And then manually add them to your build path/classpath.

Another approach is to use Maven to handle all that. We just need to tell Maven what all dependencies we need. Rest, it will handle. It will go out and download the JAR files and then make them available during compile/ run.

# HOW IT WORKS

We have a Project Configuration file that will be read by Maven. Then, it will check the local Maven repository on your computer to see if you have those JARs available there. If not, it will then reach out to the Maven Central Repository (remote) for those JAR files.

Maven is based on the project object model and stores projects in a Pom.xml file format. That's why you will see that a Spring project that is generated with Maven using Spring Initializr has a Pom.xml file.

When Maven retrieves a project dependency, it will also download supporting dependencies. For example, Spring depends on common logging etc. It will handle all this automatically for us.

Finally, when we build and run the app, Maven will handle the class / build path for us. Based on the pom.xml file, it will add the JAR files accordingly.
