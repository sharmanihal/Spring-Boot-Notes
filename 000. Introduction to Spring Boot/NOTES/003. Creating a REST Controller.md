Since we do not have any code that will handle requests made to some URLs, we will not get anything in the browser when we go to something like "localhost:8080". We will see an error instead.

To handle this, we can create a REST Controller. We will understand it in detail later, but for now, just understand that it is used to make Restful web services.

We can convert any class into a Rest Controller using the @RestController annotation. And then, inside that class, we write methods that will handle requests to various routes.

So, this is how the Rest Controller class will look like -

    @RestController
        public class FunRestController {
        
            // expose "/" that returns "Hello World"
            @GetMapping("/")
            public String sayHello() {
                return "Hello World!";
            }
        }

No need to worry about the annotations at the moment. Just understand that whenever a request comes for "localhost:8080", the "sayHello()" method will be called, and it returns a String "Hello World" as a response which is then rendered on the browser.
