We always want to have a configurable app which means we want to avoid hard-coding the values.

We can put the values in the application.properties file and then whenever we want any value, we can read it from that file. This file is located at "src/main/resources/application.properties".

And we can define any custom properties in this file and then access them using "@Value" annotation in the code.

Let's say we have the application.properties file where we want to define the first name and last name.

So, we can add them like this - 

    first.name=John
    last.name=Doe

And now, let's say instead of us returning "Hello World", we want to actually return this name. So, we have to read the values from the properties file.

So, inside our controller, we have to define two new variables that will hold the values.

    @Value("${first.name}")
    private String firstName;

    @Value("${last.name}")
    private String lastName;

Note that we used the @Value annotation on these variables and we have specified the "key" that we have in the properties file. In this way, we have tied the "firstName" to the value of "first.name" key and the "lastName" to the value of "last.name" key in the application.properties file.

And that's pretty much it! That's how we can read properties from the application.properties file.
