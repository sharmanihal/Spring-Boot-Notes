What exactly do we mean when we say "Spring Projects"?

These are additional Spring modules that are built on top of the core Spring Framework.

So, Spring is modular in design which means you can start with a small project and just use what you actually need. 

These are a few common Spring Projects - 

1. Spring Boot - Takes an opinionated view of building Spring applications and gets you up and running as quickly as possible.
2. Spring Framework - Provides core support for dependency injection, transaction management, web apps, data access, messaging, and more.
3. Spring Data - Provides a consistent approach to data access â€“ relational, non-relational, map-reduce, and beyond.
4. Spring Cloud - Provides a set of tools for common patterns in distributed systems. Useful for building and deploying microservices.
5. Spring Security - Protects your application with comprehensive and extensible authentication and authorization support.

These are only a few of the commonly used Spring Projects. But, there are a lot more. You can read about them here - https://spring.io/projects
