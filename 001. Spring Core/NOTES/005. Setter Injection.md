While the Constructor Injection is where we inject dependencies by calling the Constructor, the "Setter Injection" is the one where we inject the dependencies by calling the setter methods on our class.

So, in Setter injection, the dependencies are declared as private instance variables and the corresponding setter methods are defined. These Setter methods are then annotated with @Autowired annotation. In this way, Spring Boot will use these setters to inject the specific dependencies into the class.

Unlike Constructor Injection where all the dependencies passed are required, the Setter Injection allows for optional dependencies and the ability to change dependencies at runtime.

So, this is how our DemoController would look like if we use Setter Injection instead of Constructor Injection - 


    @RestController
    public class DemoController {
        
        private Coach coach;
        
        @Autowired
        public void getCoach(Coach coach) {
            this.coach = coach;
        }

        @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
        String getWorkout() {
            return coach.getDailyWorkout();
        }
    }

Unlike Constructor Injection, the dependencies cannot be declared as "final" in case of Setter Injection.
