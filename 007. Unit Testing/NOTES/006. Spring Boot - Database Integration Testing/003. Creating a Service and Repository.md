As we have done countless time already, we first define a new service interface and then a class that implements that interface -

    public interface StudentAndGradeService {
        public void createStudent();
    }

    @Service
    @Transactional
    public class StudentAndGradeServiceImpl implements StudentAndGradeService{

        @Override
        public void createStudent(String firstName, String lastName, String email) {

            CollegeStudent student = new CollegeStudent(firstName, lastName, email);

            studentRepository.save(student);
        }
    }

Again, we have a problem here because we do not have a "studentRepository" yet. So, let's create one - 

    @Repository
    public interface StudentRepository extends CrudRepository<CollegeStudent, Integer> {
        public CollegeStudent findByEmailAddress(String email);
    }

Note that since we are using Spring Data JPA, we do not need to implement the "findByEmailAddress" method as Spring will do that based on the method name itself.

And now, we can autowire this in the Service class and then our code is complete - 

    @Service
    @Transactional
    public class StudentAndGradeServiceImpl implements StudentAndGradeService{
        
        StudentRepository studentRepository;
        
        @Autowired
        public StudentAndGradeServiceImpl(StudentRepository studentRepository) {
            this.studentRepository = studentRepository;
        }

        @Override
        public void createStudent(String firstName, String lastName, String email) {

            CollegeStudent student = new CollegeStudent(firstName, lastName, email);

            studentRepository.save(student);
        }
    }

And finally, we can now autowire the service and repository dependencies in our test class - 

    public class StudentAndGradeServiceTest {

        @Autowired
        StudentAndGradeService studentService;

        @Autowired
        StudentRepository studentRepository;

        @Test
        public void createStudentService() {
            studentService.createStudent("John", "Doe", "johndoe@gmail.com");

            CollegeStudent student = studentRepository.findByEmailAddress("johndoe@gmail.com");

            assertEquals("johndoe@gmail.com", student.getEmailAddress(), "Find by email");
        }
    }

Now, when we run this test, we see that the test passed. But wait, we did not even configure our database yet. How did the test still pass?

The thing is, in Spring Boot, if an embedded database is a dependency, then SPring Boot will automatically configure the database connection.

If you look at the pom.xml file, we have an "H2" dependency and so, Spring Boot automatically configures the connection to an embedded H2 database.

And that's the reason why our test passed because there is a database that Spring has automatically configured.
