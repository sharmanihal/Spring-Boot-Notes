As we start, we do not have our DAOs set up so for them, we will use Spring Data JPA.

And for database, we will use an in-memory H2 database. An in-memory database is good for testing so you can quickly set it up and tear it down. Moreover, there is no network latency so tests run faster.

The very first step is ofcourse to create a new "test" directory in our "src" folder. This directory will have a "java" folder and inside that, we will create a new package that has same name as the package in the "main -> java" folder. And in that we will write our test classes. 

So, let's setup up our first test class named "StudentAndGradeServiceTest" - 

    @TestPropertySource("/application.properties")
    @SpringBootTest
    public class StudentAndGradeServiceTest {

        @Test
        public void createStudentService() {

        }
    }

Since we want our tests to drive the development, we can write - 

    @Test
    public void createStudentService() {
        studentService.createStudent("John", "Doe", "johndoe@gmail.com");

        CollegeStudent student = studentRepository.findByEmailAddress("johndoe@gmail.com");

        assertEquals("johndoe@gmail.com", student.getEmailAddress(), "Find by email");
    }

At this point, the IDE will show errors because we do not have a student service or a student repository yet. So, we will now create these classes.
