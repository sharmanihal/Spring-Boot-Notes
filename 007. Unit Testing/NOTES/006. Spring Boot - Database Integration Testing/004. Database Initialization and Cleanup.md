Whenever we perform an integration testing with a database, each test should run from a known state. Before each test, we should perform initialization. For example, insertion of data.

And after each test, we should perform cleanup. For example, deletion of sample data.

For this, we can use the annotations such as @BeforeEach, @AfterEach etc.

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;
    
    @BeforeEach
    public void setupDatabase () {
        CollegeStudent student = new CollegeStudent("Eric", "Roby","ericroby@gmail.com");
        studentRepository.save(student);
    }

    @AfterEach
    public void cleanDatabase() {
        studentRepository.deleteAll();
        jdbcTemplate.execute("ALTER TABLE student ALTER COLUMN ID RESTART WITH 1");
    }

Note that here, while we used the Spring Data JPA to save and delete the student. But in the @AfterEach, we also use "JdbcTemplate" because after we clear the table, we want to make sure any new insertion will insert a row with id as "1". Because if we do not do that, the id of the new row will always keep incrementing, even if it is the first row in this table.
