In our UI, we delete grades as well as we have the cross icon after each grade entry. It is not working at the moment so for now, we will focus on the backend logic for deleting grades.

So, yet again, we will use TDD here so first, we will write a failing test case for deleting a grade.

    @Test
    public void deleteGradeTest() {
        assertEquals(1, studentService.deleteGrade(1, "math"), "Returns student id after delete");
    }

So, just a simple test that calls the "deleteGrade" method of the service and this method will take the id of the grade to delete and the type of grade to delete.

For now, we do not have this method in our service class yet so we have to create it.

First, we add it to the interface - 

    public interface StudentAndGradeService {
        public int deleteGrade(int id, String gradeType);
    }

And then to the implementation - 

    public int deleteGrade(int id, String gradeType) {
        int deletedGradeId = 0;
        
        return deletedGradeId;
    }

For now, we have not added any logic. We just added this method to make the test run.

Ofcourse the test fails as we expected.

Now, let's write the main logic to delete a grade.

    public int deleteGrade(int id, String gradeType) {
        int deletedGradeId = 0;

        if (gradeType.equals("math")) {
            Optional<MathGrade> grade = mathGradeRepository.findById(id);
            if (grade.isEmpty()) return deletedGradeId;
            deletedGradeId = grade.get().getStudentId();
            mathGradeRepository.deleteById(id);
        }

        return deletedGradeId;
    }

So, we delete the grade if that particular grade exists in the database. And our test passes.

And now, we can do the same with the History and Science grades.

So, our test will look like - 
    
    @Test
    public void deleteGradeTest() {
        assertEquals(1, studentService.deleteGrade(1, "math"), "Returns student id after delete");
        assertEquals(1, studentService.deleteGrade(1, "science"), "Returns student id after delete");
        assertEquals(1, studentService.deleteGrade(1, "history"), "Returns student id after delete");
    }


And, our service method will now look like - 

    @Override
    public int deleteGrade(int id, String gradeType) {
        int deletedGradeId = 0;

        switch (gradeType) {
            case "math" -> {
                Optional<MathGrade> grade = mathGradeRepository.findById(id);
                if (grade.isEmpty()) return deletedGradeId;
                deletedGradeId = grade.get().getStudentId();
                mathGradeRepository.deleteById(id);
            }
            case "science" -> {
                Optional<ScienceGrade> grade = scienceGradeRepository.findById(id);
                if (grade.isEmpty()) return deletedGradeId;
                deletedGradeId = grade.get().getStudentId();
                scienceGradeRepository.deleteById(id);
            }
            case "history" -> {
                Optional<HistoryGrade> grade = historyGradeRepository.findById(id);
                if (grade.isEmpty()) return deletedGradeId;
                deletedGradeId = grade.get().getStudentId();
                historyGradeRepository.deleteById(id);
            }
        }

        return deletedGradeId;
    }

# TESTING THE NEGATIVE SCENARIOS

What if the grade id is not present in the databse or the grade type is invalid? We should write tests for those scenarios as well.

    @Test
    public void deleteGradeInvalidTest() {

        // Invalid Grade Id
        assertEquals(0, studentService.deleteGrade(123, "math"), "Returns 0 as the passed student id is not present in database");

        // Invalid Grade type
        assertEquals(0, studentService.deleteGrade(1, "geography"), "Returns 0 as the passed grade type is invalid");
    }

# UPDATING THE DELETE STUDENT TEST

Now, it makes sense that if we delete a student, that should also delete the respective grades from the database, right?

And that's the modification we will be making to our delete student test so that we also make sure that when we delete a student, we also delete the related grades.

    @Test
    public void deleteStudentTest() {
        assertTrue(studentService.checkIfStudentExists(1), "Student with id 1 should exist in the database");

        Optional<MathGrade> mathGrade = mathGradeRepository.findById(1);
        Optional<ScienceGrade> scienceGrade = scienceGradeRepository.findById(1);
        Optional<HistoryGrade> historyGrade = historyGradeRepository.findById(1);

        assertTrue(mathGrade.isPresent());
        assertTrue(scienceGrade.isPresent());
        assertTrue(historyGrade.isPresent());

        studentService.deleteStudent(1);

        mathGrade = mathGradeRepository.findById(1);
        scienceGrade = scienceGradeRepository.findById(1);
        historyGrade = historyGradeRepository.findById(1);

        assertFalse(mathGrade.isPresent());
        assertFalse(scienceGrade.isPresent());
        assertFalse(historyGrade.isPresent());
        assertFalse(studentService.checkIfStudentExists(1), "Student with id 1 should no longer exist in the database");
    }

So here, along with checking that the student is not present in the database after deletion, we also check that the respective grades are not present as well.

But the test will fail because we have no logic to also delete the respective grades when we delete a student.

Well, the solution is simple, we can simply add a OnetoMany mapping in the CollegeStudent entity class and make sure to cascade the delete operation.


    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "student_id")
    private List<MathGrade> mathGrades;

    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "student_id")
    private List<ScienceGrade> scienceGrades;

    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "student_id")
    private List<HistoryGrade> historyGrade

And that's it! Now, when we delete a student, that will also delete the respective grades.

And now, the test passes!
