Currently the app does not have a method to retrieve the student information like the name, email, grade etc. We will apply TDD to implement this functionality.

So, let's write a test first - 

    @Test
    public void studentInformationTest() {

        CollegeStudent student = studentService.getStudentInformation(1);

        assertNotNull(student);
        assertEquals(1, student.getId());
        assertEquals("Eric", student.getFirstname());
        assertEquals("Roby", student.getLastname());
        assertEquals("ericroby@gmail.com", student.getEmailAddress());

        assertEquals(1,student.getMathGrades().size());
        assertEquals(1,student.getScienceGrades().size());
        assertEquals(1,student.getHistoryGrades().size());

    }

So, right now, we do not have a method in our service that will return our the student information so let's add it.

    @Override
    public CollegeStudent getStudentInformation(int id) {
        return null;
    }

For now, it returns null and so, the test fails as the first assert statement expects the student to not be null.

So, let's implement the method in the service - 

    @Override
    public CollegeStudent getStudentInformation(int id) {
        Optional<CollegeStudent> student = studentRepository.findById(1);
        return student.orElse(null);
    }

Now, if we run the test, it should pass right?

Well, it does not. And the reason is the @OneToMany annotation because by default, the "Fetch Type" for @OneToMany is "Lazy" which means when we fetch the College Student details from the database, it won't fetch the grades along with that. It will only fetch them when we call the getters for the grades. But the thing is, when we call the getters to get the math, science and history grades, the Hibernate session has already closed so we get the no session error.

And so, we have to manually fetch the grades by the particular student id and then set them for the particular student.

    @Override
    public CollegeStudent getStudentInformation(int id) {
        Optional<CollegeStudent> student = studentRepository.findById(id);
        
        if (student.isPresent()) {
            Iterable<MathGrade> mathGradeIterable = mathGradeRepository.findGradeByStudentId(id);
            List<MathGrade> mathGrades = new ArrayList<>();
            mathGradeIterable.forEach(mathGrades::add);

            Iterable<ScienceGrade> scienceGradeIterable = scienceGradeRepository.findGradeByStudentId(id);
            List<ScienceGrade> scienceGrades = new ArrayList<>();
            scienceGradeIterable.forEach(scienceGrades::add);

            Iterable<HistoryGrade> historyGradeIterable = historyGradeRepository.findGradeByStudentId(id);
            List<HistoryGrade> historyGrades = new ArrayList<>();
            historyGradeIterable.forEach(historyGrades::add);
            
            student.get().setMathGrades(mathGrades);
            student.get().setScienceGrades(scienceGrades);
            student.get().setHistoryGrades(historyGrades);
        }
        
        return student.orElse(null);
        
    }

And now, our test passes.

And similarly, we can write a test where we pass an invalid id and then make sure it returns "null".

    @Test
    public void studentInformationInvalidTest() {
        CollegeStudent student = studentService.getStudentInformation(123);

        assertNull(student);
    }

# USING JOIN FETCH

We can also use JOIN FETCH to fetch the grades along with the student information but there is one problem. We cannot write - 

    entityManager.createQuery("FROM CollegeStudent s JOIN FETCH s.mathGrades JOIN FETCH s.scienceGrades JOIN FETCH s.historyGrades WHERE s.id = :id", CollegeStudent.class)
                .setParameter("id", id).getSingleResult();

Because this will throw an exception saying -

    cannot simultaneously fetch multiple bags

This is a common issue while using JOIN FETCH to fetch data from multiple tables in a single JPQL query. The workaround is to do this fetching in three difference JPQL queries for the three grade tables that we have.

    public CollegeStudent getStudentDetailsWithGrades(int id) {

        CollegeStudent student = entityManager.createQuery("FROM CollegeStudent s JOIN FETCH s.mathGrades WHERE s.id = :id", CollegeStudent.class)
                .setParameter("id", id).getSingleResult();

        student = entityManager.createQuery("FROM CollegeStudent s JOIN FETCH s.scienceGrades WHERE s.id = :id", CollegeStudent.class)
                .setParameter("id", id).getSingleResult();

        student = entityManager.createQuery("FROM CollegeStudent s JOIN FETCH s.historyGrades WHERE s.id = :id", CollegeStudent.class)
                .setParameter("id", id).getSingleResult();

        return student;
    }

And now, we can use this one method that will give us the student details and also the grades for that student.

    @Override
    public CollegeStudent getStudentInformation(int id) {
        Optional<CollegeStudent> studentOptional = studentRepository.findById(id);
        if (studentOptional.isPresent()) {
            return this.getStudentDetailsWithGrades(id);
        }
        return null;
    }

# IMPORTANT NOTE

You may find some exceptions thrown in the console if some table does not have any data in it so to tackle it, just update your method to get the student information with grades like this - 

    @Override
    public CollegeStudent getStudentInformation(int id) {
        Optional<CollegeStudent> studentOptional = studentRepository.findById(id);
        if (studentOptional.isPresent()) {
            return this.getStudentDetailsWithGrades(studentOptional.get(), id);
        }
        return null;
    }

So now, we are sending the actual Student that we get from "findById" call as the parameter for "getStudentDetailsWithGrades".

And then, inside "getStudentDetailsWithGrades", we do -

    private CollegeStudent getStudentDetailsWithGrades(CollegeStudent student, int id) {

        try {
            student = entityManager.createQuery("FROM CollegeStudent s JOIN FETCH s.mathGrades WHERE s.id = :id", CollegeStudent.class)
                    .setParameter("id", id).getSingleResult();
        } catch(Exception ignored) {}


        try {
        student = entityManager.createQuery("FROM CollegeStudent s JOIN FETCH s.scienceGrades WHERE s.id = :id", CollegeStudent.class)
                .setParameter("id", id).getSingleResult();
        } catch(Exception ignored) {}

        try {
        student = entityManager.createQuery("FROM CollegeStudent s JOIN FETCH s.historyGrades WHERE s.id = :id", CollegeStudent.class)
                .setParameter("id", id).getSingleResult();
        } catch(Exception ignored) {}

        return student;
    }

Note how we have try catch statements around each JOIN FETCH query.

# NEXT STEPS

Now that we have done this, you can practice and implement functionalities for Creating and Deleting Grades. For that, you will need the Math, Science and History repository interfaces to interact with their respective database tables. If you get stuck anywhere, do not worry as the code in this project already has all of that implemented. Moreover, we also have all the tests implemented.

Finally, we can update our Thymeleaf template for "studentInformation" and remove all the hardcoded HTML.
