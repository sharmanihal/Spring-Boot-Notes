So far we have tested the database integration. 

What about testing the MVC Web Controllers?

How to create HTTP requests and send them to the controller?

How can we verify the HTTP response? How to verify things like the status code or the view name or the model attributes?

Well, Spring provides support for testing MVC Controllers and we can use "MockMvc". "MockMvc" provides an elegant and easy-to-use API to call web endpoints and to inspect and assert their response at the same time.

There is no need to run a server at all.

In our current project, we have one controller class named "GradebookController" which has one simple request mapping - 

    @RequestMapping(value = "/", method = RequestMethod.GET)
	public String getStudents(Model m) {
		return "index";
	}

So basically, when a request is made to the root url, then it will return a view file named "index.html" that is present in "resources/templates" folder.

And we want to write a test for this controller.
