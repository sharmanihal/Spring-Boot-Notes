So first, we will create a new test class named "GradebookControllerTest". And we will annotate it with @SpringBootTest and @TestPropertySource, just how we have been doing so far - 

    @TestPropertySource("/application.properties")
    @SpringBootTest
    public class GradebookControllerTest {
    }

Now, when we test the MVC Controllers, we use an annotation on our test classes named "AutoConfigureMockMvc".

As the name says, this annotation with automatically configure the "MockMvc" for our tests.

"MockMvc" is a powerful tool for testing Spring MVC controllers. It allows you to simulate HTTP requests and test the response from your controller.

    @TestPropertySource("/application.properties")
    @AutoConfigureMockMvc
    @SpringBootTest
    public class GradebookControllerTest {
    }


Now, we can inject the "MockMvc" dependency in this class and also get the Mock object for the service since we may need that for tests.

    @TestPropertySource("/application.properties")
    @AutoConfigureMockMvc
    @SpringBootTest
    public class GradebookControllerTest {

        @Autowired
        private MockMvc mockMvc;

        @Mock
        private StudentAndGradeService studentAndGradeService;
    }

Note that we used @Mock and not @MockBean here because we know that we just need a mock object of the service. We are not testing the service itself so we do not care about its dependencies at all.

Just like how we did in case of Database integration testing, we can add a new student to the H2 database in @BeforeEach and also clear the database in @AfterEach.

    @Autowired
    private StudentRepository studentRepository;

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    @BeforeEach
    public void init() {
        CollegeStudent student = new CollegeStudent("Eric", "Roby","ericroby@gmail.com");
        studentRepository.save(student);
    }

    @AfterEach
    public void cleanup() {
        studentRepository.deleteAll();
        jdbcTemplate.execute("ALTER TABLE student ALTER COLUMN ID RESTART WITH 1");
    }

Why did we use @Autowired here for the StudentRepository and not @Mock? Well, because we know that we need the actual object here to put the data in the H2 database. We do not need a mock object here.
