So we wrote the code that makes all the tests pass. But ofcourse that means our focus was not on writing a good code, but rather on making all the tests pass.

This means, there is still scope of refactoring our code so that not only the tests pass, the code is still efficient and easy to read.

Ofcourse in our case, it is already efficient and readable because we have a simple function. So, we do not really need any refactoring in this case.

But, most of the time, there is always scope for refactoring and as we discussed before, TDD gives you that confidence of refactoring your code as you can always make sure the refactor does not make any previous tests fail which ensures that no previous functionality is impacted with any new change.
