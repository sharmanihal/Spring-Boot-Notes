JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation". It is a data interchange format that provides a standardized and efficienct way for different systems to exchange data.

It is a 'text-based' format to store and exchange data in a way that is both human-readable and machine-parsable. As a result, JSON is relatively easy to learn and to troubleshoot. 

JSONâ€™s language-independent nature makes it an ideal format for exchanging data across different programming languages and platforms.

# SIMPLE JSON EXAMPLE

Let's see how a JSON data looks like - 

    {
        "id": 14,
        "firstName": "Mario",
        "lastName": "Rossi",
        "active": true
    }

JSON works by representing data in a hierarchical fashion, using key-value pairs to store information. JSON data is enclosed in curly braces ({}), with each key-value pair separated by a comma (,).

The "keys" are always in "double-quotes".

As for the "values", they can be Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Arrays, null, and even a Nested JSON object.
