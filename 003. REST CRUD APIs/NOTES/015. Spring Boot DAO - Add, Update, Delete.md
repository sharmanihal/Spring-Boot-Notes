Let's now also add the functionality to add, update and delete employees from the database in our Spring Boot project. Because so far, we only have one functionality present in our project which is to fetch all the employees from the database.

Before we start, here are some best practices for the Service Layer - 

1. Apply transactional boundaries at the service layer.
2. It is the responsibility of the service layer to manage transaction boundaries
3. For implementation code, apply @Transactional on service methods and remove the @Transactional annotation from the DAO methods if they exist.

# GETTING A SINGLE EMPLOYEE

Let's start with adding the functionality to fetch a single employee by the ID from the database.

We will have a method named "findById" in our DAO interface which will be implemented by the DAOImpl class.

The DAO Interface will look like - 

    public interface EmployeeDAO {

        // Get a list of all the employees
        List<Employee> findAll();

        // Get a specific employee by id
        Employee findById(int id);
    }

And this is how we will define the method in the Impl class - 

    @Override
    public Employee findById(int id) {
        return entityManager.find(Employee.class, id);
    }

Pretty simple.

# ADDING OR UPDATING AN EMPLOYEE

Next, let's add a method that takes care of adding or updating an employee in the database.

    public interface EmployeeDAO {

        // Get a list of all the employees
        List<Employee> findAll();

        // Get a specific employee by id
        Employee findById(int id);

        // Add a new employee if it does not already exist or update if it does
        Employee save(Employee employee);
    }

Here is the Impl class - 

    @Override
    public Employee save(Employee employee) {
        return entityManager.merge(employee);
    }

Note that we are using "merge()" here because merge will insert new objects if they do not already exist and update the existing ones if they already exist. And this method will return the object that represents the newly added or updated row in the database.

Notice that we did not add "Transactional" annotation here even though we are adding or updating data from the database table. That's because we will do that in the service layer.

# DELETING AN EMPLOYEE

Finally, let's add a new method in the DAO Interface for deleting an employee using the id.

    public interface EmployeeDAO {

        // Get a list of all the employees
        List<Employee> findAll();

        // Get a specific employee by id
        Employee findById(int id);

        // Add a new employee if it does not already exist or update if it does
        Employee save(Employee employee);

        // Delete an Employee
        void delete(Employee employee);
    }

This is how the implementation looks like in the DAOImpl class - 


    @Override
    public void delete(Employee employee) {
        // Delete the employee
        entityManager.remove(entityManager.merge(employee));
    }

Note that we have to use "merge" inside "entityManager.remove" method in this case because we are getting the employee object from outside. If you did not understand what that means, then go over the "Deleting Objects with JPA" file in the "Hibernate & JPA" notes.
