The REST Controller class in Spring Boot is annotated with the @RestController annotation. And this annotation is actually a combination of two annotations - 

    1. @Controller
    2. @ResponseBody

The @Controller annotation is specialization of @Component.

The @ResponseBody annotation tells a controller that the object that is returned is automatically serialized into JSON and passed back into the HttpResponse object.

For example - 

    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("books-rest")
    public class SimpleRestController {...}

And inside the Rest Controller class, we set up mappings for various HTTP methods for various endpoints.

    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("books-rest")
    public class SimpleRestController {

        @GetMapping("/hello")
        public String sayHello() {
            return "Hello World!";
        }
    }

So, in above example, when the user makes a GET request to "localhost:8080/books-test/hello", then "Hello World!" will be the response from the server.

This "/books-test/hello" is called a REST endpoint.

For simple GET requests, we can use the web browser as well but when it comes to advanced REST testing so PUT or POST methods, then "POSTMAN" has a much better support. You can post JSON data, set content types, pass HTTP request headers, perform authentication and so on.
