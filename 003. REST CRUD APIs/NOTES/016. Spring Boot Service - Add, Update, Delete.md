Next up, we have to implement the add, update and delete functionality in our Service layer. That will be pretty straightforward as we just need to use the methods that we have in the DAO.

So, this is what the Service Interface will look like - 

    public interface EmployeeService {

        // Get a list of all the employees
        List<Employee> findAll();

        // Get a specific employee by id
        Employee findById(int id);

        // Add a new employee if it does not already exist or update if it does
        Employee save(Employee employee);

        // Delete an Employee
        void delete(Employee employee);
    }

This is what the Service class will look like after implementing all the methods - 

    @Service
    public class EmployeeServiceImpl implements EmployeeService{
        private EmployeeDAO employeeDAO;

        @Autowired
        public EmployeeServiceImpl(EmployeeDAO employeeDAO) {
            this.employeeDAO = employeeDAO;
        }

        @Override
        public List<Employee> findAll() {
            return employeeDAO.findAll();
        }

        @Override
        public Employee findById(int id) {
            return employeeDAO.findById(id);
        }

        @Override
        @Transactional
        public Employee save(Employee employee) {
            return employeeDAO.save(employee);
        }

        @Override
        @Transactional
        public void delete(Employee employee) {
            employeeDAO.delete(employee);
        }
    }

Notice the @Transactional annotation on the service class methods.
