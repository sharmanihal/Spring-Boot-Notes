While we have created our DAO and added one method in it to get a list of Employees from the database, there is no way to actually see this in action yet. Let's also create our controller that will use the methods of the DAO and return the data that we can then see using a REST Client.

    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("/api")
    public class EmployeeController {

        // Quick and Dirty - Inject Employee DAO (We will replace it with service layer later)
        private EmployeeDAO employeeDAO;

        @Autowired
        public EmployeeController(EmployeeDAO employeeDAO) {
            this.employeeDAO = employeeDAO;
        }

        // Expose "/employees" and return a list of employees
        @GetMapping("/employees")
        public List<Employee> getEmployees() {
            return employeeDAO.findAll();
        }
    }

Note that later, we will replace the "DAO" with a service class in our Controller because ideally, we should not directly deal with the DAO in our Controller class. But for now, let's use the DAO and inject it using Constructor Injection in our Controller class.

And then, we create a new controller method for the "/employees" endpoint so that when a GET request is made to this endpoint, we return a list of employees. Note that we are using "RestController" annotation which uses the "@ResponseBody" annotation under the hood and takes care of converting the returned value to JSON.

Finally, we run our application and if everything was right, we should see the following on the browser or the REST client when you go to "http://localhost:8080/api/employees" - 


    [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "firstName": "Leslie",
            "lastName": "Andrews",
            "email": "leslie@luv2code.com"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "firstName": "Emma",
            "lastName": "Baumgarten",
            "email": "emma@luv2code.com"
        },

        },

        },

        }
    ]
