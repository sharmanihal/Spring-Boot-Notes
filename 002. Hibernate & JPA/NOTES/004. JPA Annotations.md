When we have to map the Java objects to teh database tables, we use the annotations in Spring Boot. We can either say "Hibernate" annotations or "JPA" annotations because in Spring Boot, "Hibernate" is the default implementation of JPA.

So, going forward, we will simply use the term "JPA".

Let's talk about some annotations in JPA.

# @ENTITY ANNOTATION

An Entity Class is the Java class that is mapped to a database table. To make any class as an Entity class, we have the @Entity annotation.

For example, suppose we have a "Student" class with id, firstName, lastName, and email.

When JPA maps it to a database table, it will create a new table named "student" which has four columns "id", "first_name", "last_name" and "email".

    @Entity
    public class Student {...}

The minimum requirements for a class to be an Entity class are - 

    1. It should have the @Entity annotation
    2. It should have a public or protected no-argument constructor. It can have other constructors but they are optional.

Just a small constructor refresher - 

    1. If you do not declare any constructors in your class, Java will provide a no-argument constructor to you.
    2. If you declare constructors with arguments, then you do not get a no-argument constructor. In this case, you have to explicitly declare one.

Now, you may think, what about the entity name? Well, by default, the name is the class name. But, we can set custom name by providing a "name" parameter in the @Entity annotation.

    @Entity(name="student")
    public class Student {...}

It is important to note that "Entity" classes must not be declared as "final" because many JPA implementations will try to subclass our entity to provide their functionality. And as we know, a "final" class cannot be extended to create a subclass. That's why, we should not declare "Entity" classes as "final".

# @TABLE ANNOTATION

This annotation is used to specify the table name. This annotations can accept for attributes -> name, schema, catalog and uniqueConstraints.

For example, we want to map our "Student" class to a table named "student" in the database. So, we will write - 

    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {...}

If we do not use the @Table annotation, Spring Boot will take the table name as the name of the entity. But, it is recommended that you explicitly provide the table name so that in the future, code refactoring (such as changing the name of Entity class name) does not affect the mapping.

# @ID ANNOTATION

Each JPA entity must have a primary key that uniquely identifies it. The @Id annotation defines the primary key. We can generate the identifiers in different ways, which are specified by the @GeneratedValue annotation.

There are four Id generation strategies that we can choose - 

    1. AUTO
    2. TABLE
    3. SEQUENCE
    4. IDENTITY

The `@GeneratedValue` annotation in **JPA** is used to specify how the **primary key** (usually annotated with `@Id`) will be generated for an entity. This means you don’t have to manually assign values to the ID field for new entities. Instead, the persistence provider (like Hibernate) will generate it for you based on the chosen **strategy**.

Here’s a beginner-friendly explanation of all the strategies provided by `GenerationType`:

---

### **1. GenerationType.AUTO**
- **What it does**: The persistence provider (e.g., Hibernate) automatically decides the best generation strategy based on the database and the provider.
- **How it works**:
  - It is the default strategy.
  - If you're using a database that supports sequences (e.g., PostgreSQL or Oracle), Hibernate might use a sequence.
  - If you're using MySQL, which uses `AUTO_INCREMENT`, Hibernate might use an identity column.
- **When to use**: 
  - When you're unsure about the database you're using or want Hibernate to handle it automatically.

**Example**:
```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
private Long id;
```

---

### **2. GenerationType.IDENTITY**
- **What it does**: The primary key is generated using the database's **auto-increment** feature.
- **How it works**:
  - The database generates the ID during the insertion of the row (e.g., using `AUTO_INCREMENT` in MySQL).
  - The application doesn’t know the ID until the entity is saved to the database.
- **Limitations**:
  - It can cause performance issues with batch inserts because each insert requires the database to return the newly generated ID.
- **When to use**:
  - When you’re working with a database that supports auto-increment columns (like MySQL).

**Example**:
```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long id;
```

**Behind the scenes** (MySQL):
```sql
CREATE TABLE event (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  event_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

---

### **3. GenerationType.SEQUENCE**
- **What it does**: Uses a **database sequence** to generate unique IDs.
- **How it works**:
  - A sequence is a separate database object that keeps a counter.
  - Hibernate fetches the next value from the sequence and uses it as the ID.
  - You can customize the sequence name if needed.
- **Advantages**:
  - Efficient for generating IDs because the application can fetch sequences in batches.
- **When to use**:
  - When the database supports sequences (e.g., PostgreSQL, Oracle, or H2).

**Example**:
```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "event_seq")
@SequenceGenerator(name = "event_seq", sequenceName = "event_sequence", allocationSize = 1)
private Long id;
```

**Behind the scenes** (PostgreSQL):
```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE event_sequence START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;
CREATE TABLE event (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  event_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

---

### **4. GenerationType.TABLE**
- **What it does**: Uses a special **table** in the database to generate and store unique ID values.
- **How it works**:
  - A dedicated table is created to keep track of ID counters for different entities.
  - Hibernate queries and updates this table to generate IDs.
- **Why it’s less common**:
  - Slower than other strategies because it requires an additional database query to fetch the next ID.
  - Rarely used in modern systems since `SEQUENCE` is more efficient and widely supported.
- **When to use**:
  - When your database doesn’t support sequences or auto-increment (e.g., older databases).

**Example**:
```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE, generator = "event_table_generator")
@TableGenerator(
    name = "event_table_generator",
    table = "id_generator",
    pkColumnName = "entity_name",
    valueColumnName = "next_id",
    pkColumnValue = "event",
    allocationSize = 1
)
private Long id;
```

**Behind the scenes**:
A table is created to store the ID counters:
```sql
CREATE TABLE id_generator (
  entity_name VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
  next_id INT
);

INSERT INTO id_generator (entity_name, next_id) VALUES ('event', 1);
```

### **How They Compare**
| **Strategy**      | **When to Use**                          | **Performance**      | **Database Dependency**            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `AUTO`            | Default, when unsure                     | Depends on provider  | Flexible, adapts to database        |
| `IDENTITY`        | For auto-increment support (e.g., MySQL) | Slower for batches   | Requires auto-increment support     |
| `SEQUENCE`        | For sequence support (e.g., PostgreSQL)  | High performance     | Requires sequence support           |
| `TABLE`           | Legacy systems without sequences         | Slowest             | Works everywhere (but inefficient)  |

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Start with `AUTO`** unless you know exactly what strategy you need.
- If you're using MySQL, **`IDENTITY`** is usually chosen by default.
- For databases like PostgreSQL or Oracle, **`SEQUENCE`** is the preferred choice.
- Avoid **`TABLE`** unless you're working with a database that doesn’t support modern ID generation methods. 

---
So, let's say that in our Student class, we want the "id" column to be the primary key. So, we can use @Id annotation on it.

    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {

        @Id
        private int id;
    }

The "Identity" GenerationType is recommended in most of the cases.

    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {

        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        private int id;
    }

# @COLUMN ANNOTATION

This annotation is used to tell Spring Boot which class property maps to which column. In a lot of cases, the column name will not be same as the class property so we have to explicitly tell Spring Boot about that using @Column annotation.

For example, the class property is "firstName" but in the database table, column is "first_name". So, we have to explicitly mention this - 

    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {

        @Id
        private int id;

        @Column(name="first_name")
        private String firstName;
    }

If we don’t specify this annotation, the name of the column in the table will be the name of the field. For example, in case of the "id". 

But, this is something you should avoid because suppose if we refactor the java code sometime in the future. If we change the class property names, it will affect the mapping as well. But, if we use the @Column annotation on all the properties, then it does not matter what the class property is named.

    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {

        @Id
        @Column(name="id")
        private int id;

        @Column(name="first_name")
        private String firstName;
    }

This @Column annotation also takes some other attributes like "length", "nullable" and "unique".

The "length" element specifies its length. The "nullable" element specifies whether the column is nullable or not, and the "unique" element specifies whether the column is unique.


# FINAL ENTITY CLASS CODE

This is how our "Student" class should look like after we apply all the annotations that we discussed above -


    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {

        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        @Column(name = "id")
        private int id;

        @Column(name="first_name")
        private int firstName;

        @Column(name="last_name")
        private int lastName;

        @Column(name="email")
        private int email;

        // No argument constructor (Explicitly defined as we have an argument constructor as well)
        public Student() {}

        // Constructor with arguments
        public Student(int firstName, int lastName, int email) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName = lastName;
            this.email = email;
        }

        // Getter and Setters

        public int getId() {
            return id;
        }

        public void setId(int id) {
            this.id = id;
        }

        public int getFirstName() {
            return firstName;
        }

        public void setFirstName(int firstName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
        }

        public int getLastName() {
            return lastName;
        }

        public void setLastName(int lastName) {
            this.lastName = lastName;
        }

        public int getEmail() {
            return email;
        }

        public void setEmail(int email) {
            this.email = email;
        }

        // toString() Method

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Student{" +
                    "id=" + id +
                    ", firstName=" + firstName +
                    ", lastName=" + lastName +
                    ", email=" + email +
                    '}';
        }
    }
