Spring provides a @Transactional annotation which automatically begins and ends a transaction for your JPA code.

It means, any database operations performed will be executed within a transaction. If the transaction is successful the changes are committed to the database. If not, then the changes will not be persisted.

So, in our StudentDAOImpl, since we have a method that adds a new row to the table, we want this change to be committed only if the transaction is successful. So, we can annotate this method with @Transactional

    @Override
    @Transactional
    public void save(Student student) {
        entityManager.persist(student);
    }

Note that @Transactional is imported from "org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional".

By default, the @Transactional annotation will create a new transaction for the marked method or class if one does not already exist. If a transaction does already exist, the marked method or class will be executed within the existing transaction.

What Does "Existing Transaction" Mean?

If you have a parent method that has already started a transaction (for example, a service method), and within this method, you call another method that is annotated with @Transactional, that second method will participate in the same transaction (unless you explicitly change the behavior using PROPAGATION).
Example:

Consider the following example:

```
@Service
public class StudentService {

    @Transactional // This method starts a transaction
    public void enrollStudent(Student student) {
        studentRepository.save(student); // This will be part of the transaction
        sendEnrollmentEmail(student); // This will also be part of the same transaction
    }

    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW) // This method will always start a new transaction
    public void sendEnrollmentEmail(Student student) {
        // Sending an email logic (doesn't depend on the student repository save)
    }
}  

```
You can also specify the propagation behaviour of a transaction by using the propagation attribute of the @Transactional annotation. For example, you can specify that a transaction should always be created, regardless of whether a transaction already exists, by using the PROPAGATION_REQUIRED_NEW attribute:

    @Override
    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED_NEW)
    public void save(Student student) {
        entityManager.persist(student);
    }

You can also specify the isolation level of a transaction by using the isolation attribute. The isolation level determines how much a transaction is isolated from other transactions. For example, you can use the ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE attribute to specify that the transaction should be completely isolated from other transactions:


### Summary of Isolation Levels:

- **`READ_UNCOMMITTED`**: Allows dirty reads (transactions can read uncommitted data).
- **`READ_COMMITTED`**: Avoids dirty reads, but non-repeatable reads are allowed.
- **`REPEATABLE_READ`**: Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads.
- **`SERIALIZABLE`**: Provides the highest isolation, preventing dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads, but can significantly impact performance.


    @Override
    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED_NEW, isolation = Isolation.SERIALIZABLE)
    public void save(Student student) {
        entityManager.persist(student);
    }

You can also specify the maximum time that a transaction should take to complete by using the timeout attribute. For example, you can use the following code to specify that a transaction should time out after 10 seconds:

    @Override
    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED_NEW, isolation = Isolation.SERIALIZABLE, timeout = 10)
    public void save(Student student) {
        entityManager.persist(student);
    }

The @Transactional annotation also supports other attributes, such as "readOnly", which can be used to indicate that a transaction should be read-only, and "rollbackFor", which can be used to specify the exceptions that should cause a transaction to roll back.
