1. **Read Operation Without `@Transactional`:**
   - A new `EntityManager` will still be created by the proxy (Spring always creates one per DAO method).
   - However, since no transaction is active:
     - Entities fetched from the database will be **detached** (not part of any persistence context).
     - **Dirty checking** and flushing (saving changes to the database) won't happen, because these operations depend on a persistence context tied to a transaction.
   - **Bottom Line**: You can read data, but there’s no persistence context for managing entities, and changes cannot be tracked or saved.

2. **Read Operation With `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`:**
   - A new `EntityManager` will be created and tied to a **read-only transaction**.
   - Benefits of `readOnly = true`:
     - Hibernate disables **dirty checking** (no tracking of changes to entities).
     - Hibernate skips the **flush** step, improving performance since no changes are expected to be saved.
   - **Bottom Line**: You get better performance and proper management of the persistence context for consistent reads, but no entities are saved.

3. **Write Operation With `@Transactional`:**
   - A new `EntityManager` will be created and tied to a **read-write transaction**.
   - Entities are added to the persistence context and managed.
   - Hibernate performs dirty checking and flushes changes to the database at the end of the transaction.

4. **Write Operation With `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`:**
   - This is a **misuse** of `readOnly = true`. 
   - Even though entities might be managed (added to the persistence context), the transaction is flagged as read-only, so Hibernate will throw an exception if you try to persist or update anything.
   - **Bottom Line**: Never use `readOnly = true` for write operations.

### Summary:
- For **read operations**:
  - Without `@Transactional`: Entities are detached, and there’s no persistence context.
  - With `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`: Entities are managed, but no dirty checking or flush operations occur.
- For **write operations**:
  - Use `@Transactional` for proper entity management, persistence, and database updates.
  - Avoid `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` for write operations; it will cause errors.

Would you like me to show code examples to illustrate these points?
