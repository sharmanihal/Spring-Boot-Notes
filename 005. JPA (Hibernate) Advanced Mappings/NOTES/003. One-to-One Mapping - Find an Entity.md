Now that we have defined a method to save an Entity in the database, let's also define a method to find an entity and that's fairly straightforward because we have done it in the past.

We can simply use the "find" method of the Entity Manager for this and all that we need to pass is the primary key or the "id".

    public interface AppDAO {
        void save (Instructor instructor);
        Instructor findInstructorById(int id);
    }

This is the implementation of this method -

    @Override
    public Instructor findInstructorById(int id) {
        return entityManager.find(Instructor.class, id);
    }

So, let's use this method inside our main app to find the Instructor with an id = 1 since we already added one instructor before.

Note the SQL query in the terminal - 

    select i1_0.id,i1_0.email,i1_0.first_name,id1_0.id,id1_0.hobby,id1_0.youtube_channel,i1_0.last_name 
    from instructor i1_0 
    left join instructor_detail id1_0
    on id1_0.id=i1_0.instructor_detail_id where i1_0.id=?

So, Hibernate sees that there is a One to One mapping between the "instructor" and the "instructor_detail" tables with the foreign key column being the "instructor_detail_id". And because we have not explicitly defined a "fetchtype", it is by default "EAGER" which means that it will also fetch the data from the "instructor_detail" table, even if we do not want it at this point.

So, it runs a query where it uses a "LEFT JOIN" to combine the data from the two tables and then it gives us the result.

    Instructor{id=1, firstName='John', lastName='Doe', email='john@gmail.com', instructorDetail=InstructorDetail{id=1, youtubeChannel='https://www.youtube.com/xyz', hobby='Code!!'}}
