Let's now add some code to fetch the course along with its reviews.

We can use the "JOIN FETCH" here again as we want the Course and Reviews all at once.

    @Override
    public Course findCourseAndReviewsByCourseId(int id) {

        // Create a Query
        TypedQuery<Course> query = entityManager.createQuery("FROM Course c JOIN FETCH c.reviews WHERE c.id = :id", Course.class);

        query.setParameter("id", id);

        // Execute the query
        return query.getSingleResult();
    }

So, the query that runs is - 

    select c1_0.id,c1_0.instructor_id,r1_0.course_id,r1_0.id,r1_0.comment,c1_0.title from course c1_0 join review r1_0 on c1_0.id=r1_0.course_id where c1_0.id=?

And now, we can get the course details as well as the reviews from this one single query.

    int id = 10;
	System.out.println("Finding the course with id: " + 10);
	Course course = appDAO.findCourseAndReviewsByCourseId(id);
	System.out.println("Course is: " + course);
	System.out.println("Reviews are: " + course.getReviews());
