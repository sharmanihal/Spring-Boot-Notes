What if we want to find a Student and the courses in which the student is enrolled in? Well, we can do that as well because we know that in the "Student" entity class, we have a reference to the List of courses for that Student.

Again, we have to add a new method in our DAO Interface - 

    public interface AppDAO {
        Student findStudentAndCourseByStudentId(int id);
    }

The implementation is simple - 

    @Override
    public Student findStudentAndCourseByStudentId(int id) {
        TypedQuery<Student> query = entityManager.createQuery("FROM Student s JOIN FETCH s.courses WHERE s.id = :id", Student.class);

        query.setParameter("id", id);

        return query.getSingleResult();
    }

And now, let's call this method in our main class and see the SQL query that runs.

The SQL query that runs is -

select s1_0.id,c1_0.student_id,c1_1.id,c1_1.instructor_id,c1_1.title,s1_0.email,s1_0.first_name,s1_0.last_name from student s1_0 join course_student c1_0 on s1_0.id=c1_0.student_id join course c1_1 on c1_1.id=c1_0.course_id where s1_0.id=?

So again, it will use the "course_student" table to find the courses that the particular student with the provided id is associated with.
