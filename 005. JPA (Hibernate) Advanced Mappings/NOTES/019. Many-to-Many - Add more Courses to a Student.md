Let's try something better.

What if we want to update a student in our database to add some more courses to that student?

In this case, we have to do an UPDATE operation.

So, let's add a new method in our DAO to update the student.

    public interface AppDAO {
        void update(Student student);
    }

And the implementation is like this - 

    @Override
    @Transactional
    public void update(Student student) {
        entityManager.merge(student);
    }

Now the main coding will be in the main class where we find a student first and then add some new courses to its existing list of courses.

    private void findStudentAndAddCourses(AppDAO appDAO) {

		// Find the student
		int id = 1;
		System.out.println("Finding the student with id: " + 10);
		Student student = appDAO.findStudentAndCourseByStudentId(id);
		System.out.println("Student is: " + student);
		System.out.println("Courses are: " + student.getCourses());

		// Create a couple of new courses for the student
		Course course1 = new Course("Understanding Networks");
		Course course2 = new Course("Object-Oriented Programming");

		// Add the courses to the list of courses
		student.add(course1);
		student.add(course2);

		// Call the DAO method to update the student
		appDAO.update(student);

		System.out.println("STUDENT UPDATED");

	}

And now, behind the scenes, Hibernate will take care of inserting a new course into the "course" table and also adding new rows into the JOIN TABLE "course_student" for this newly added course for the specific student.
