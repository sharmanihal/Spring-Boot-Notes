Finally, let's also look at deleting an entity. Again, we define a new method inside the DAO interface - 

    public interface AppDAO {
        void save (Instructor instructor);
        Instructor findInstructorById(int id);
        void deleteInstructorById(int id);
    }

And then implement this method inside DAOImpl class - 

    @Override
    @Transactional
    public void deleteInstructorById(int id) {
        entityManager.remove(entityManager.find(Instructor.class, id));
    }

And now, when we use this method in our main app, look at the terminal and see what happens.

This is the first SQL query that runs -

    select i1_0.id,i1_0.email,i1_0.first_name,id1_0.id,id1_0.hobby,id1_0.youtube_channel,i1_0.last_name from instructor i1_0 left join instructor_detail id1_0 on id1_0.id=i1_0.instructor_detail_id where i1_0.id=?

And this query is ran because before deleting, we use "find" method to actually retrieve the instructor from the table. And since fetch type of "EAGER", it will also fetch the Instructor Details. 

Next, it runs this SQL query - 

    delete from instructor where id=?

So, it first removes the row from the "instructor" table.

Then, it runs this SQL query - 

    delete from instructor_detail where id=?

So, it also removes the respective row in "instructor_detail" table.

And this happens because we have set the "CASCADE" type as "ALL" which means if we do a delete operation on "instructor" table, this operation will be cascaded to the "insturctor_detail" table as well.
